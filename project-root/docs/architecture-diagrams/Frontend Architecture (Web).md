Explanation:

Components/Pages: UI building blocks which render based on props and global state.
Redux Store: Maintains the global state (current user, rides list, bookings).
Axios: Handles HTTP communication with the backend.
React Router: Manages SPA navigation.
Tailwind CSS: Applies styling through utility-first classes.
