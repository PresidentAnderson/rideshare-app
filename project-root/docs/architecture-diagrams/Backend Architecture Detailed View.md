Backend Architecture Detailed View
Description:
The backend architecture shows how the Node.js server (Express.js) communicates with various services and how the request flows from the controller routes through services and into the database/cache layers.

Explanation:

Routers/Controllers: Receives HTTP requests and maps them to appropriate service functions.
Services: Contain the core business logic and interact with DAOs.
Data Access Layer (DAO): Handles all read/write operations to PostgreSQL and interacts with Redis for caching.
Adapters: Specialized modules for communicating with external services (e.g., Stripe payments, Google Maps).
